# Aeris
The Aeris project is made up of 13 engineering students with differing professions: Computer Science, Statistics and Data Science, Mechanical Engineering, Materials Engineering, Data Theory, and Electrical Engineering. While we come from different fields, we all share the same goal, to evolve and change the engineering world. 
This project aims to automate personal cooling with a face-tracking fan that adjusts its direction automatically, improving comfort and convenience. Future enhancements may include temperature-based speed control, voice commands, and mobile app integration.
