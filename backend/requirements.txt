# Notes / fallback:
# - If pip fails stating a wheel is not available for your Python version, either:
#   * install via conda: `conda install numpy opencv -c conda-forge`, or
#   * download a matching prebuilt `.whl` for numpy from PyPI / a trusted wheel host
#     and install it first with `python -m pip install <numpy‑wheel-file>.whl` then
#     run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` (which will then use the binary
#     wheels already present).
